--- abstract

This memo specifies how the post-quantum signature scheme ML-DSA (FIPS 204)
is used for authentication in TLS 1.3.

# Introduction

ML-DSA {{!FIPS204=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.204}} is one of the first
two post-quantum signature schemes standardised by NIST. It is a
module-lattice based scheme.

This memo specifies how ML-DSA can be negotiated for authentication in TLS 1.3
via the "signature_algorithms" extension.

# ML-DSA SignatureSchemes Types
As defined in {{RFC8446}}, the SignatureScheme namespace is used for
the negotiation of signature scheme for authentication via the
"signature_algorithms" extension. This document adds three new SignatureSchemes
types for the three ML-DSA parameter sets as follows.

~~~
enum {
  mldsa44(0x0900),
  mldsa65(0x0901),
  mldsa87(0x0902)
} SignatureScheme;
~~~

These correspond to ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-64, and ML-DSA-87 defined
in {{FIPS204}} respectively. Note that these should not be confused
with prehashed variants such as HashML-DSA-44 also defined in {{FIPS204}}:
we use the pure version.

Similarly, the context parameter defined in {{FIPS204}} Algorithm 2/Algorithm 3
MUST be the empty string.

The corresponding end-entity certificate when negotiated must
use id-ML-DSA-44, id-ML-DSA-64, id-ML-DSA-87 respectively
as defined in {{I-D.ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates}}.
